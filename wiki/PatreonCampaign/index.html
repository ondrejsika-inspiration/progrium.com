  <p>And this is where I make the case for people to pay me patronage. This is a draft for an eventual campaign on <a href="https://www.patreon.com">Patreon</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Jeff Lindsay is creating amazing open source tools, videos, and articles.</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to my Patreon page. Patreon lets you set up a monthly subscription to donate and support my work so I can keep doing it and do more of it! Yay!</p>

<h2 id="who-are-you">Who are you?</h2>

<p>My name is Jeff Lindsay. I'm an open source programmer from San Jose, California now living in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>I build tools. I can't help it. I think a lot about how to increase the capability of anybody that can code. And how to make it easier, pleasant even, to do things the right way. But mostly how to make possible what a younger version of myself would stay up late wishing for.</p>

<p>In the process, I envisioned webhooks, started SuperHappyDevHouse, built RequestBin, localtunnel, gave talks, co-founded Hacker Dojo, helped create Docker, built Dokku, and made over 100 other projects. I've inspired many other projects and communities, but have also just been around for a lot of amazing things.</p>

<p>I also like filmmaking, game design, and writing and recording metal. I'm very complicated!</p>

<h2 id="why-patreon">Why Patreon?</h2>

<p>You might be thinking, <em>"What's the problem? You're a talented software engineer. Get a high paying tech job!"</em></p>

<p>Well I've done that a few times in my life with some great companies. Despite that and despite learning a lot, those were always my least productive and least satisfying periods.</p>

<p>To this you may reply, <em>"So start your own company!"</em></p>

<p>Ah now, definitely more my speed. I've been an entrepreneur since I was in elementary school. I always thought I would start a big tech company. When I was 17, I started my first corporation. I've started a few actually. It just didn't fit either for some reason. So I've been an independent contractor most of my life.</p>

<p><em>"That's it then, that works right?"</em> you ask.</p>

<p>Yes and no. Time spent working with clients is rarely an investment in my goals, of which there are plenty. In fact, contracting can push me in directions I don't want to go. I'll defend and encourage freelance lifestyle until I die, but I'll be honest it can be much more stressful than a regular salaried job. But at least I have my own time to build stuff sometimes.</p>

<p><em>"When were you most productive?"</em></p>

<p>Not just productive, the happiest time in my life was when Digital Ocean sponsored my work for 4 months. I was the happiest I can remember because it was like a salaried job, I didn't have to worry about money, and yet I could build everything I wanted, the way I wanted. <em>I produced 20 projects in 4 months</em>, some of which, for example Registrator and Logspout, have become staples in the Docker world.</p>

<p>My initial goal with this Patreon is to try to recreate that situation of "base living expenses are covered so now you can work on what you want as much as you want." Sounds selfish right? It kind of is, but at least I selfishly want to put great tools, knowledge, and ideas into the world.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-cost-of-living">Beyond Cost of Living</h2>

<p>Luckily my cost of living is relatively low. I live in Austin, I'm not married or have kids, and all I do is work. I could probably get by on $3-4k/mo, but with debt and planning ahead, my goal is $6k.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, if you're feeling adventurous, I can tell you about a vision of the future that â€¦ blah blah</p>
