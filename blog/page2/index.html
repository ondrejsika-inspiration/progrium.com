            <h1><a href="/blog/2015/12/04/leadership-guilt-and-pull-requests/">Leadership, Guilt, and Pull Requests</a></h1>
            <p>I have a lot of <a href="https://github.com/progrium?tab=repositories">open source projects</a>. Even more with <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs?tab=repositories">Glider Labs</a>. Some of them are fairly popular. All of them get me excited. But most of them also bum me out. I'm going to share one of the reasons I've had to take a break for the past couple months, and why all my repositories are now looking for more maintainers.</p>

<p>Open source is hard. It seems easy, though. You just write a piece of software and put it on Github, right? Well that was the easy part. Now comes maintenance. And very likely politics. Inevitably, guilt. Multiply that by the number of open source projects you have and their popularity. End result: open source can be a bummer.</p>

<p>Jacob Thornton (<a href="https://twitter.com/fat">@fat</a>), co-author of Bootstrap, gave a talk a few years back echoing the sentiment of many open source authors and maintainers. He calls it Cute Puppy Syndrome. It's not the best analogy, but it gets the point across. Open source projects, like puppies, are great fun when they start. As they get older and more mature, responsibility seems to outweigh their cuteness. One solution is to put your old dog up for adoption and get a new puppy. As you can tell from his delivery, this analogy is intended to be humorous:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UIDb6VBO9os?start=1190" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>He mentions that many authors of popular open source projects have gotten burnt out and look for an exit. Often handing projects off to maintainers, sometimes never to return. Not to avoid responsibility, but to stay sane. Still, much of the time, that sense of responsibility lingers. As Jacob expands on the puppy analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have your puppy and it turns into a dog, you put it up for adoption, you give it to a maintainer. And then he over feeds it and it becomes fat and bloated. And you just sit there and you're really sad because you don't really have time to take care of your puppy any more, but you don't want to see it fat and bloated. So you're just real sad all the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Alternatively, you can let issues and PRs pile up. Guilt and sadness either way. At least opening the project up lets it survive and continue to provide value to a larger audience. You just have to let go of the project as it will now evolve in ways you might not agree with.</p>

<p>When I did this with <a href="http://progrium.viewdocs.io/dokku/">Dokku</a>, the new maintainers did a great job at keeping the project and community healthy. I can't thank them enough for that. I had to let go quite a bit, but the project would probably be dead without them.</p>

<p>In fact, there's something interesting about maintainers that didn't author the project. It's probably different from person to person and project to project, but the maintainers of Dokku don't have the guilt or burden that I do. They're happy to help, and as volunteers don't feel like they owe anybody anything. It's really the ideal situation. Perhaps authors <em>shouldn't</em> be maintainers after a certain point.</p>

<p>That said, even with these great maintainers, Dokku really only kept on an incremental path of maintaining the status quo. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it meant Dokku wasn't able to develop further in the directions I had originally intended. I thought to myself, well eventually I'll find time to do a system-wide refactoring to get it on this path I want and submit these as PRs like any other contributor. That time never came, and the project continued to fall behind from the evolving larger vision. The project I started was not living up to my own expectations for it.</p>

<p>Sadness. Guilt.</p>

<p>Then I did something different. It was so simple. I wrote a wiki page describing what I wanted and why I wanted it. For some reason it came as a surprise to me that the maintainers started moving the project in that direction! Did it happen exactly how I'd do it? Not always. But it still brought the project closer to what I wrote down.</p>

<p>This shouldn't have come as a surprise. In essence, this is leadership. There are different forms of leadership, but at the core is the idea of "saying what, not how". It can be very hard for programmers to get into this mindset because our medium is all about the how. Stepping back and writing what you want with flexibility towards how it's implemented takes practice.</p>

<p>This experiment with Dokku was far from perfect. In fact, that document is still incomplete. Project leadership is just as ongoing as maintenance. However, it's something worth getting better at. It's essential to authoring many open source projects and remaining happy enough to keep going. In the case of my projects, since there is always a bigger picture they fit into, it's even more important.</p>

<p>Dokku is just one of many projects, but Dokku is one of my only projects that I'm not an active maintainer. Dokku isn't why I had to take a break, it was all the others.</p>

<p>Some of you might have seen my ramblings about <a href="http://progrium.com/blog/2015/10/05/the-next-10-years-megalith/">Megalith</a>. Some of you might even be able to follow them enough to see that most of my open source projects are all basically part of Megalith. Or that Megalith is basically all my projects. You can probably see how this leadership is critical to sustain all these projects while keeping them moving in roughly the same direction.</p>

<p>I don't write open source software to make money. In fact, even solving a particular problem is secondary to working towards a vision of how the world should be. Since that's really what's important to me, I should be spending my time on being an effective leader. At the very least, documenting what I want, the direction, why it's important, what design principles are involved, preferred architectural patterns, and so on. Then helping people understand, integrating their feedback, and letting go of a lot of the details.</p>

<p>To support this, I need to open up our projects to more maintainers. Going forward, I'll be trying a variation of the <a href="http://felixge.de/2013/03/11/the-pull-request-hack.html">Pull Request Hack</a> to get more people involved across all projects. If you submit a solid substantial PR or several solid minor PRs to any Glider Labs project, you'll be invited to have commit access across all projects.</p>

<p>Starting now, all public projects under <a href="https://github.com/progrium">my username</a> or <a href="https://github.com/gliderlabs">Glider Labs</a> have an open call for maintainers. If you'd like to volunteer to help maintain any of these projects, just <a href="http://glider-slackin.herokuapp.com/">join our Slack</a> and in <code>#intros</code> say you're interested in becoming a maintainer.</p>

<p>From there I'll do my best to provide guidance and leadership. Together we'll keep making great things!</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2015/10/05/the-next-10-years-megalith/">The Next 10 Years: Megalith</a></h1>
            <p>I've decided what I'm going to be working on for the next 10 years. It's epic and exciting, and I'm going to need your help. It's called Megalith.</p>

<p>Megalith is a symbol of the ideal I've been working towards my entire career. It's constantly evolving and very nuanced. I'm going to be upfront and say that I'm not going to be able to fully explain what Megalith is in this post. Instead, I'm going to start setting up context. To me, context is everything.</p>

<p>For the past few years I've been spending most of my working hours writing open source software related to a project I worked on in 2012 called <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a>. Docker was created as a skunkworks collaboration between me and some talented engineers at dotCloud, now Docker. The company pivoted 100% to Docker and is now worth about a billion dollars. As an independent, I didn't stay with Docker, I moved on to the next problem. Docker was one piece of a grander vision.</p>

<p>To help pay for this lifestyle, I've experimented with sponsorships and even fell into lucky situations. Last year I tried to make it a little more sustainable by starting <a href="http://gliderlabs.com">Glider Labs</a> with a friend. We focused on consulting around Docker. We helped some of the first people to actually run Docker in production. We did this to learn and get a better grasp on the Real Problems. Something many vendors in this space don't really do. We learned a lot and as a result we ended up making a lot more open source software.</p>

<p>The problem is that there is a lot more to make. This ideal I have in mind that's been developing in my head for over 5 years is a massive undertaking. I've realized if I'm going to keep pursuing it, I need two things: a better vehicle for the work, and a unifying project to get help around it.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-better-organization-for-this-work">Building a better organization for this work</h2>

<p>The software I write that people love comes from a compulsive drive that goes beyond and even against the idea of startups. With the exception of Docker and a few other collaborations, I've never made anything that people loved while working for a startup. Naming and evangelizing webhooks was not something anybody paid me to do. In fact, a lot of projects I've built or think should exist are too small to sustain a startup. Does that mean they shouldn't be built? Or that I should temporarily dedicate my life to maybe make one of them work as a startup?</p>

<p>Even a lifestyle business is quite a commitment to make work. My friend <a href="https://inconshreveable.com/">Alan Shreve</a> made <a href="https://ngrok.com/">Ngrok</a>, inspired by my tool <a href="https://github.com/progrium/localtunnel">Localtunnel</a>. It's free and open source, but he's also bootstrapped a business out of it. This business is what he spends most his working hours on.</p>

<p>Given my goals and values I do prefer this approach, but it still poses a problem. The time spent writing lines of code to support a business, the time spent figuring out market fit, the time spent on support and operations … this is time not moving forward to me. It's extracting wealth out of something that already exists.</p>

<p>Why do this? So Alan can sustain himself and potentially fund other projects, right? In the meantime, I know for a fact that there's a lot of great open source software that he's not making.</p>

<p>His goal is passive income. For a lot of us independents, that's the dream. It may or may not realize in full, but it's certainly time consuming either way. In that way, it's sort of just a smaller variation of the startup lottery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the same time, I've put out dozens of open source projects that solve problems or work towards dissolving larger problems in the long-term. I actually can't help it. It's compulsive like I said. The only way I see it stopping is if I leave the space altogether. I don't get paid to do 90% of these projects. They help bring me contract work, but seemingly only to take time away from supporting and building a community around those projects.</p>

<p>The other problem, for me, is that running a business causes you to make software differently. You think about building software you can sell, or that supports what you can sell. More than doing one thing well, you think about the features people will pay for. More than making it simple, you think about obscure enterprise and legacy use cases. Conventional knowledge says you must do those in some way at some point because that's How It Works.</p>

<p>The problem is worse for startups that take VC money. Even VCs that "get it" and let you focus on open source traction still expect you to eventually figure out how to monetize and make them millions. To varying degrees this often makes startups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>focus on enterprise customers, not regular developers</li>
  <li>ship software that solves short-term problems, or yesterday's problems</li>
  <li>prioritize sexy demoware without production hardening</li>
  <li>increase perceived value with more hires and more partnerships</li>
  <li>de-prioritize any effort outside the product that makes money</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://hashicorp.com/">Hashicorp</a> is one of the best examples of companies in this space that have done a good job at taking just enough VC and working against a lot of these forces. However, they still work within the framework. They still have a commitment to exit big someday. The implications of this are not insignificant.</p>

<p>I'm much more likely to bootstrap a company like Alan than take VC money. Not only is it just more my style, but a VC startup just won't play to my strengths. Though, building a bootstrap business doesn't seem to produce the most value for my time either. Or make me very happy.</p>

<p>I'd much rather find a new way. Not just because I want to play to my strengths, but because I know I'm not the only one this applies to. I also know that a different, better kind of open source software will result if done properly.</p>

<p>What I want is something of an independent R&amp;D lab. I want us to <a href="http://gliderlabs.com/blog/2015/04/08/what-have-we-been-doing-for-40-years/">re-capture</a> the innovation and <em>invention</em> of Xerox PARC and Bell Labs, but focusing on open source. I want us to have the freedom to explore and build software <em>right</em> with like-minded people. Not to get rich, but to <em>slow cook software</em>. Systems software that further empowers individuals and small groups … enterprise customers of the future, not the past.</p>

<p>This is what I want Glider Labs to transition into. In fact, it's already been operating like this in a way. And I've been exploring and learning ways to make this work for years now. It's part business, part cooperative, part public service. But to make the leap to a lab that supports more than myself, it won't happen over night. And I can't do it by myself.</p>

<h2 id="sharing-the-vision-enabling-participation">Sharing the vision, enabling participation</h2>

<p>This isn't just about a new organization. It has to have some purpose, some initial unifying project. In order to start from nothing, there needs to be a clear mission of value. Not just boundless experimentation. Luckily, most of my work does fall under a certain theme driven by a nebulous but nonetheless motivating ideal. That seems like a good place to start.</p>

<p>I've been told if I just wrote down everything I want to build and why, people might be willing to help out. This is challenging both because of scope and its constant evolution. I figured if I just keep making projects people will start to see it, but other than a few people I'm not sure that's working out. So I'm going to try a more top-down approach.</p>

<p>The real project this post is about is a meta-project I'm calling Megalith. It's an umbrella project to help unify and bring a common goal to all the work I've been doing for the past 10 years, and over the next 10 years.</p>

<p>I know I can't do it alone, so the project is designed for participation. It will involve many more specific projects that are open source and independently useful. Many already exist. Most do not.</p>

<p>Whether or not the final ideal is achieved, it will be approached. Lots of value will be produced in the process. Not just software and contributions to existing open source, but guides and how-to knowledge of everything I've learned to lead me to my current conclusions, and everything we learn in the process.</p>

<p>Glider Labs and Megalith are separate but related parts of this venture. Megalith is the meta-project, Glider Labs is the organization. The idea is that they support each other. Megalith makes this new Glider Labs a reality, Glider Labs makes Megalith a reality.</p>

<h2 id="relevant-to-your-interests">Relevant to your interests?</h2>

<p>The first step is to explain Megalith and try to communicate this idea in my head, or at least some manifestation of it. Then everything else will start to make sense. It's almost more about approach and values. It's about an idea of simple, composable, extensible tools to make modern end-to-end development and operations sane at both large and small scale. And making the world more programmable…</p>

<p>Anyway, it's more than I can get into here. I've set up <a href="http://eepurl.com/bAietL">an announcement mailing list</a> you can subscribe to. Sign up and you'll get emails about what's next. I might even email you directly to say hi.</p>

<p>Feel free to get in touch with me, leave a comment below, or help out by sharing this post if it resonates with you. I'm pretty excited, especially since a lot of people have expressed interest so far.</p>

<p>Lastly, here's a silly video I made about it:</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2014/10/28/deis-breathes-new-life-into-dokku/">Deis Breathes New Life into Dokku</a></h1>
            <p>Today I'm excited to announce that <a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku">Dokku</a> is now sponsored by my friends of the <a href="http://deis.io/">Deis</a> project. This means that <a href="http://opdemand.com/">OpDemand</a>, the company behind Deis, will be funding part-time development of Dokku and its components.</p>

<h2 id="remember-dokku">Remember Dokku?</h2>

<p>A little over a year ago, <a href="http://progrium.com/blog/2013/06/19/dokku-the-smallest-paas-implementation-youve-ever-seen/">I announced Dokku</a> as an open source "Docker powered mini-Heroku." It quickly became the first killer application for Docker. Designed to be simple and hackable, Dokku enables web developers to run their own single-host PaaS that's directly compatible with Heroku.</p>

<p>As the project took off, I went on to tackle the challenges of a multi-host PaaS with the <a href="https://flynn.io/">Flynn</a> team. Even without me, the Dokku community continued to grow, thanks to the help of new maintainers and contributors. The experimental plugin system allowed all sorts of customizations and extensions of Dokku to flourish.</p>

<p>Over time, though, the wonderful volunteer maintainers of the project started to get burnt out. Handling issues across a dozen language runtimes and even more plugins is taxing. Many were upstream buildpack or Docker issues, or larger inherent problems of the project requiring stronger leadership to resolve.</p>

<p>Although Dokku is still used and loved today, without active maintainership and leadership, it was at risk of "bit rot". I came to the conclusion that it was in need of some love from the original author. Luckily, the Deis team was willing to help make this happen and is effectively saving the project from a slow death.</p>

<h2 id="about-deis">About Deis</h2>

<p>Not long after I started collaborating with the Flynn team, another project called Deis came onto the scene. Both projects have the goal of being enterprise grade, multi-host PaaS solutions. Although technically competitive, as open source projects composed of great people, we openly share information and components. As an independent agent, I try to bridge silos and facilitate that kind of sharing and communication. I'd gone out to visit both teams to collaborate, talk shop, and have fun.</p>

<p>I eventually moved on from Flynn and started independently exploring distributed systems components in a Docker world. Deis continued to adopt and support many of my open source components. They always kept an open dialog with me and others in the Docker community. When I mentioned my plans to reinvigorate Dokku, they were quick to offer help.</p>

<h2 id="the-sponsorship">The Sponsorship</h2>

<p>The timing for this sponsorship is perfect. Deis now requires at least 3 hosts in a cluster, making Dokku the obvious recommendation for smaller deployments. The projects will focus on shared components even more. This sponsorship will also ensure a smooth migration to Deis if a Dokku user wants to go down that path.</p>

<p>What is Dokku expected to get? First, time and thought put into getting the project modernized and on path for a solid 1.0 release. Among other things, this involves redesigning aspects of the project to make it more sustainable as an open source project.</p>

<p>Much of the lessons of Flynn and Deis, as well as reflections on Dokku itself, will feed back into Dokku. My plan is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>make it more robust and testable</li>
  <li>improve code quality and standards</li>
  <li>properly direct upstream issues upstream</li>
  <li>improve documentation and basic support processes</li>
  <li>add popular features, such as addons and Dockerfile build support</li>
</ul>

<p>And if you can believe it, I plan to make it more modular and even simpler.</p>

<h2 id="yay-dokku">Yay, Dokku!</h2>

<p>Along with Deis, I want to thank all the <a href="https://github.com/progrium/dokku/graphs/contributors">contributors</a> and maintainers involved in Dokku. I especially want to thank asm89, rhy-jot, plieter, fcoury, and josegonzalez. The project would already be dead without them. If you want to get involved, I'll generally be in the <code>#dokku</code> channel on Freenode sharing updates as I progress. Most of my work will be in a new branch, but first it will take place in creating and updating components used by Dokku.</p>

<p>I'm only able to put a day or so of hours a week into the project, but steady, consistent effort and help from the community will ensure Dokku will be around for a long time!</p>
