            <h1><a href="/blog/2012/09/07/let-me-tell-you-about-my-website/">Let me tell you about my website</a></h1>
            <p>Since mid-July I've been on vacation traveling around the world. Originally, the only project I allowed myself to work on is my website and blog. I quickly broke that rule with a number of new and existing projects. Nevertheless, as you can see, I did ship this site.</p>

<p>I've never been happy with my website or blog, perhaps because I've never been able to invest enough time into it. Over the years, I've at least been able to put a lot of thought into what I want and how I want to express myself. This attempt gets pretty close.</p>

<h3 id="high-level-goals">High-level Goals</h3>
<p>Too many of my personal site designs have been dark and gloomy, often monochromatic. I think one of the biggest ideas going into this project was to make something bright and colorful. From a pure functional standpoint, I felt this was important. I also wanted to actually reflect my style. Too often I've settled for pre-designed blog themes that "kinda, sorta" match my sense of style and how I want to express myself. This time I would have full control.</p>

<p>As I'm starting to freelance again, I also wanted to have a good marketing tool for myself. Even if it just expressed the affordances I have as a free agent. If somebody discovered me online, they'd know they could buy my time. "Yes, I can be hired for any of these fine services."</p>

<p>Combining my personal website with my blog is another thing I wanted to do. So far they've always been separate. Not only would this be for consistency and simplicity, but for future proofing. Anything else I want to put online I can do with this site in a way that feels part of a whole. A whole that represents my identity and personal brand.</p>

<h3 id="aesthetic">Aesthetic</h3>
<p>Like I mentioned, I wanted bright and colorful. I also wanted simple and toy-like. I wanted it to feel well designed, but without a lot of modern web design tropes. This led to a minimalist foundation that I could sprinkle my favorite motifs on top of.</p>

<p>I actually only had one website in mind that I used for initial inspiration. In fact, I think when I came across <a href="http://disqus.com/for-websites/awesome-ux">this page of the Disqus website</a>, I immediately started imagining a new personal website. Most of that initial vision has since disappeared, but with that framing I was able to move on to colors.</p>

<p>The colors on that page reminded me of one of my favorite kinds of infographics: transit maps. I quickly started poking around ColourLovers for palettes inspired by transit maps. I found a few and settled on <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/1043750/Tokyo_Subway">one based on Tokyo's subway map</a>. Then I moved on to typeface.</p>

<p>I limited my options to what was available on Google Webfonts. Previously I was a fan of the Droid Sans and Droid Serif families. This time around, I used Open Sans as the primary font. For the header title (my name), I needed something different. I wanted something heavier but not wide. Ideally, I wanted a bold Futura Condensed, but a heavy Futura isn't on Google Webfonts.</p>

<p>I struggled with this for a while, then by accident found VT323. It had the weight and shape qualities I was looking for, but I didn't think I wanted a pixelated typeface. It seemed too cliche. However, when I tried it, it became obvious VT323 not only went well with my pixelated avatar, but it added more of me to the overall design without being too cliche.</p>

<p>The tree in the header was a late addition. I have a thing for trees as a symbol of nature and I wanted to add more character to the design. Originally I was going to use Context Free to create a procedurally generated tree, but this proved too time consuming to get what I wanted. A free vector based tree was not hard to find.</p>

<h3 id="platform">Platform</h3>
<p>I've become a fan of using <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> for simple websites. It's hosted, it's free, and powered by Git. The site is then versioned, editable online, and even forkable. The only limitation is that it only hosts static files.</p>

<p>Luckily, they've built-in support for <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, which is more or less like pre-rendering a dynamic site. This not only gives you templating, layouts, and includes, but it's "blog aware" so you get pagination, meta-data, and even related post links. The only real dynamic bits of the site are blog comments and analytics, both are solved by client-side JavaScript powered services. Neither of those I care to have in my Git repo anyway.</p>

<p>The other part of this plan I like is that it lets you write content in simple Markdown files kept in a Git repo. If I ever need, I can take this repo anywhere and still have my blog posts as Markdown files. This is a far more ideal place to be in that most blogging platforms I've used in the past.</p>

<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<p>It's still a work in progress. You may have noticed the homepage currently redirects to the blog index. I'm hoping to have more of a landing or intro page as the homepage. The idea there is to quickly communicate what I'm about and what I work on.</p>

<p>I also want to incorporate more hand-drawn elements into the design. A lot of my writing is well accompanied by diagrams and visuals, so I wanted to include more of these in my posts. Doing as many of these as I can with my drawing tablet will give the site more character. My character.</p>

<p>I was also thinking about "project pages" that describe and introduce the projects I'm involved in without being hidden as an old blog post. Perhaps more exciting, though, are project idea pages or "blueprints". These would allow me to document projects I'm thinking about building, letting me get feedback and encourage collaboration before even starting.</p>

<p>Building a site from scratch was a pretty substantial investment. With the right tools and enough time to think through and iterate on the visual design, I now have something that works and that I can build on as needed. Not only that, I shipped before I got back from vacation. :)</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2010/05/11/making-a-local-web-server-public-with-localtunnel/">Making a local web server public with localtunnel</a></h1>
            <p>These days it's fairly common to run a local environment for web development. Whether you're running Apache, Mongrel, or the App Engine SDK, we're all starting to see the benefits of having a production-like environment right there on your laptop so you can iteratively code and debug your app without deploying live, or even needing the Internet.</p>

<p>However, with the growing popularity of callbacks and <a href="http://webhooks.org">webhooks</a>, you can only really debug if your script is live and on the Internet. There are also other cases where you need to make what are normally private and/or local web servers public, such as various kinds of testing or quick public demos. Demos are a surprisingly common case, especially for multi-user systems ("Man, I wish I could have you join this chat room app I'm working on, but it's only running on my laptop").</p>

<p>The solution is obvious, right? SSH remote forwarding, or reverse tunneling. Use a magical set of options with SSH with a public server you have SSH access to, and set up a tunnel from that machine to your local machine. When people connect to a port on your public machine, it gets forwarded to a local port on your machine, looking as if that port was on a public IP.</p>

<p>The idea is great, but it's a hassle to set up. You need to make sure sshd is set up properly in order to make a public tunnel on the remote machine, or you need to set up two tunnels, one from your machine to a private port on the remote machine, and then another on the remote machine from a public port to the private port (that forwards to your machine).</p>

<p>In short, it's too much of a hassle to consider it a quick and easy option. Here is the quick and easy option:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ localtunnel 8080
</code></pre>

<p>And you're done! With localtunnel, it's so simple to set this up, it's almost fun to do. What's more is that the publicly accessible URL has a nice hostname and uses port 80, no matter what port its on locally. And it tells you what this URL is when you start localtunnel:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>$ localtunnel 8080
Port 8080 is now publicly accessible from http://8bv2.localtunnel.com ...
</code></pre>

<p>What's going on behind the scenes is a web server component running on localtunnel.com. It serves two purposes: a virtual host reverse proxy to the port forward, and a tunnel register API (try going to <a href="http://open.localtunnel.com">http://open.localtunnel.com</a>). This simple API allocates a port to tunnel on, and gives the localtunnel client command the information it needs to set up an SSH tunnel for you. The localtunnel command just wraps an SSH library and does this register call.</p>

<p>Of course, there's also the authentication part. As a free, public service, we don't want to just give everybody SSH access to this machine (as it may seem). The user localtunnel on that box is made just for this service. It has no shell. It only has a home directory with an authorized_keys file. We require you to upload a public key for authentication, and we also mark that key with options that say you can only do port forwarding. Although, it can't be used for arbitrary port forwarding… because it's only a private port on the remote side, it can only be used with the special reverse proxy.</p>

<p>So there it is. <a href="http://github.com/progrium/localtunnel">And the code is on GitHub.</a> You might notice the server is in Python and the client in Ruby. Why? It just made sense. Python has Twisted, which I like for server stuff. And Ruby is great for command line scripts, and has a nice SSH library. In the end, it doesn't matter what it's written in. Ultimately it's a Unix program.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

            <h1><a href="/blog/2010/02/02/learning-from-disparity-aka-failure/">Learning from expectation disparity, aka "failure"</a></h1>
            <p>I've long argued that failure is the only way a person can learn. This has been a very resonating bit of wisdom for me, despite the fact people have often argued against it with rather sound logic: "Yes, you can learn from failure, but you can also learn from success!" Only after reading Jason Fried's blog post from one year ago, <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1555-learning-from-failure-is-overrated">Learning from failure is overrated</a>, have I realized exactly what's wrong. We're talking about different kinds of failure.</p>

<p>Learning happens when you correct the mismatch of an expected outcome from the actual outcome. This is where the idea of learning from failure actually comes from. Failure represents a mistake in judgment, a disparity between expectation and reality. Therefore, if your expectation is validated by success and there is no disparity, then you didn't actually <em>learn</em> anything — you already knew.</p>

<p>However, validation of an expected but <em>unsure</em> success is obviously learning because it corrects the expectation of doubt you had. Furthermore, analysis of an unexpected success can result in learning from correcting the assumptions that led to expecting failure. A successful outcome, but a failure to expect it.</p>

<p>This is where the confusion comes in. Unfortunately it's an issue of semantics. The meaning of the word failure in the context of "learning from failure" is this failure to know the outcome. In this way, it's true, you can only learn from failure. However, it is only this specific instance of expectation-failure this applies to so absolutely.</p>

<p>Separately although related (which I think adds to the confusion), despite outcome-failures not necessarily teaching you what will work, they tend to be the strongest lessons experienced. I mostly attribute this to the greater level of disparity and correction made to your mental model that comes from expecting a failing outcome to succeed.</p>
